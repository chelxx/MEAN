    <h1>TOP THREE NINJAS OF FEUDAL JAPAN!</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Hattori Hanzo</h2>
    <h3>Hattori died in 1596 at the age of about 55, but his legend lives on. His image actually features in numerous manga and movies, with his character often wielding magical powers such as the ability to disappear and reappear at will, predict the future, and move objects with his mind.</h3>

    <h2>Mochizuki Chiyome</h2>
    <h3>Mochizuki Chiyome was the wife of samurai Mochizuki Nobumasa of Shinano domain, who died in the Battle of Nagashino in 1575. Chiyome herself was from the Koga clan, however, so she had ninja roots.</h3>

    <h2>Ishikawa Goemon</h2>
    <h3>In folk tales, Ishikawa Goemon is a Japanese Robin Hood, but he likely was a real historical figure and a thief from a samurai family that served the Miyoshi clan of Iga and supposedly trained as a ninja under Momochi Sandayu.</h3>
